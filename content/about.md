# 👏 About
Welcome—this microblog is my studio for collecting experiments, publishing quick notes, and reflecting on what I’m learning.


## 🗂️ Portfolio
### [Project: Minimalist Microblog](https://github.com/CuiYingyun/microblog)
A minimalist, open-source blogging system that publishes directly from GitHub Issues. It supports tagging, instant deploys, and a clean reading experience—ideal for developers who want a portable, hackable writing workflow without infrastructure overhead.

### [Project: Immersive Notepad](https://immersive-notepad.caveman.work/)
A Chrome extension designed for LLM-centric workflows. Capture snippets into focused side-panel notepads, configure shortcuts, and export locally so your prompt-building stays private and uninterrupted.

### [Project: ml.caveman.work](https://ml.caveman.work/)
A freshly launched, curated knowledge base for machine learning. It traces the field from fundamentals to advanced model analysis, blending concise explainers with practical implementation notes, and will continue to expand as new material is published.
