# 🌟 Cui.Yingyun's Microblog

A minimalist microblog powered by GitHub Issues, based on [issues-blog](https://imfing.github.io/issues-blog/).

## 📝 About

This is Cui.Yingyun's personal microblog where thoughts, insights, and daily reflections are shared. Built using GitHub Issues as the content management system, it provides a seamless writing experience while maintaining a clean, distraction-free reading interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Microblog Style**: Full content display without clicking through titles
- **GitHub Issues as CMS**: Write and manage posts directly from GitHub
- **Mobile Friendly**: Capture thoughts on-the-go using GitHub mobile app
- **Tag Support**: Organize content with GitHub labels
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme switching for comfortable reading
- **No Database Required**: All content stored in GitHub Issues

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Write**: Create a new issue in the repository
2. **Tag**: Add labels to categorize your content  
3. **Publish**: GitHub Actions automatically converts issues to blog posts
4. **Deploy**: Site updates automatically via GitHub Pages

## 🎨 Customizations

This microblog features several enhancements over the original template:

- **Inline Content Display**: Posts show full content directly on the homepage
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean interface with subtle borders and proper spacing
- **Unified Color Scheme**: No purple/primary colors, pure black and white aesthetic
- **Right-aligned Metadata**: Date and tags positioned elegantly on the right
- **English Interface**: All UI elements in English

## 📱 Writing Workflow

- ✍️ Write from anywhere - web, mobile app, or API
- 🏷️ Organize with labels (automatically become tags)
- 🔍 Built-in search functionality
- 📅 Automatic timestamp and version history
- 💬 Comments for reader engagement (if enabled)
